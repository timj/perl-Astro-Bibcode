Astro::Bibcode
==============

This module provides the ability to parse standard astronomical
bibliography codes as used by CDS, NED and ADS. Using this module
information such as the year of publication, the journal name,
volume number and page number can be obtained.

This module is useful when combined with the Astro::ADS module,
also on CPAN, which returns bibcodes.

The bibcode specification can be obtained from

 http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/refcode.html

Currently this module is at v0.01 although it should handle 
most bibcode types.

Note that the module itself is quite large due to the inclusion
of the journal and conference proceedings lookup tables required to
convert a journal code to its full length.

A simple bibcode verification utility is provided (verifybib).
